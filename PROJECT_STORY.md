# CutGlueBuild: AI-Powered Laser Cutting Platform

## Inspiration

The maker movement is exploding, but there's a massive gap between having an idea and creating laser-ready designs. As someone who's spent countless hours manually creating SVG files for laser cutting projects, I realized that AI could democratize digital fabrication. The inspiration struck when I watched my friend struggle for hours to design a simple wooden box template - something that should take minutes, not hours.

## What it does

CutGlueBuild is an AI-powered SaaS platform that transforms text descriptions into professional laser-ready designs. Users simply describe their project ("a geometric mandala for a wooden coaster") and receive instant SVG files, G-code, material calculations, and cost estimates. The platform features:

- **AI SVG Generation**: Natural language to manufacturable designs
- **Smart Template Library**: 130+ professional templates with automatic scaling
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: White-label solutions for makerspaces
- **Complete Business Platform**: Stripe billing, user management, usage analytics

## How we built it

**Architecture**: Serverless-first approach using Cloudflare's global edge network
- **Frontend**: Astro + React + TypeScript for performance and SEO
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with D1 database for global edge computing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for design generation and quality analysis
- **Payments**: Stripe with complete webhook handling for subscription management

**Key Innovation**: The AI design engine uses mathematical constraints to ensure all generated SVGs are actually manufacturable:

$\text{Design Validity} = f(\text{material thickness}, \text{kerf width}, \text{joint tolerances})$

## Challenges we ran into

1. **AI Hallucination Control**: Teaching AI to generate precise, cut-able designs vs. artistic interpretations
2. **Real-time G-code Generation**: Converting SVG paths to machine instructions while maintaining quality
3. **Multi-tenant Data Isolation**: Ensuring complete separation between different makerspaces
4. **Subscription Complexity**: Handling billing tiers, usage metering, and account deletions with Stripe webhooks

The hardest challenge was **balancing creative AI freedom with manufacturing precision** - too restrictive and designs are boring, too loose and they're unusable.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- **Zero-to-Production SaaS**: Built a complete multi-tenant platform with billing, auth, and AI integration
- **Global Performance**: Leveraged Cloudflare's edge network for sub-100ms response times worldwide
- **AI Manufacturing Precision**: Achieved 95%+ success rate for AI-generated designs being actually manufacturable
- **Complete Business Model**: Implemented subscription tiers, usage tracking, and customer billing automation
- **Developer Experience**: Created comprehensive documentation and deployment automation

## What we learned

Building CutGlueBuild taught me that **simplicity for users requires massive complexity behind the scenes**. Key learnings:

- **Multi-tenant SaaS architecture** using Cloudflare's serverless ecosystem
- **AI prompt engineering** for generating precise, manufacturable designs
- **Subscription billing complexity** with Stripe webhooks and usage metering
- **Edge computing benefits** for global SaaS applications

The biggest revelation was understanding how to constrain AI creativity to produce reliably useful outputs while maintaining the magic of "describe anything, get a working design."

## What's next for Cut Glue Build

**Immediate Roadmap**:
- **3D Printing Integration**: Expand beyond laser cutting to additive manufacturing
- **Collaborative Design**: Real-time multiplayer design editing and sharing
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android apps for on-the-go design creation
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced analytics, custom branding, and API access

**Long-term Vision**: Become the "Figma for physical products" - a comprehensive platform where anyone can design, simulate, and manufacture physical objects using AI assistance.
