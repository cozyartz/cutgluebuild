Selling laser-cut products is one of the most exciting and accessible ways to start a creative business. Whether you're creating jewelry, signage, home decor, or custom gifts, the laser cutting niche continues to grow — and you can carve out a profitable slice of that market.

In this guide, we’ll explore exactly how to go from crafting in your garage to running a real business. From finding a product niche to choosing platforms, pricing your work, and scaling — you’ll learn it all.

## Step 1: Find Your Niche

Before you even make your first product, think about **who** you're selling to.

- Do you want to target **wedding planners** with custom signs?
- Or maybe you're a parent designing educational toys?
- Perhaps you're into art and want to make **laser-cut wall decor**?

**Pro Tip:** Start small and specific. Niches like personalized gifts for dog lovers or laser-cut accessories for teachers can grow into big opportunities.

---

## Step 2: Validate Your Product Ideas

Don’t spend hours designing without checking if there's demand.

- Post designs on Instagram or Reddit groups like r/lasercutting.
- List a few mockups on Etsy without full inventory.
- Ask friends or family if they'd buy — and how much they'd pay.

**Free Market Test Tools:**
- Etsy's keyword tool
- Google Trends
- Pinterest search

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your Product Line

Focus on **3 to 5 products** that look polished and offer variation.

**Examples:**
- A set of 3 custom coasters
- Personalized name signs for nurseries
- Dog tag ornaments for the holidays

Use software like [LightBurn](https://lightburnsoftware.com/?ref=cutgluebuild-20) or Illustrator for design work. Or generate SVG templates from platforms like [CutGlueBuild](https://cutgluebuild.com) to accelerate the process.

## Step 4: Source Materials Affordably

Start with quality materials, but know your cost per unit. 

**Recommended Suppliers:**
- [Proofgrade Materials](https://shop.glowforge.com/collections/proofgrade-materials/products/wood-variety-pack?ref=cutgluebuild-20)
- [Cast Acrylic Sheets](https://amazon.com/dp/B08XYZNPQR?tag=cutgluebuild-20)
- Local cabinet or sign shops for scrap wood

Track every penny — shipping, taxes, waste — to understand your true cost per item.

---

## Step 5: Create Stunning Product Photography

Good photos = more sales.

- Use natural light or a softbox.
- Shoot from multiple angles.
- Show items **in context** (coasters on a table, signs hanging on a wall).

Tools: Use your smartphone with Lightroom presets or hire a local photographer on Fiverr.

---

## Step 6: Choose Where to Sell

### Online Marketplaces

- **Etsy** – Easiest way to start. High buyer traffic but also high competition.
- **Amazon Handmade** – For high-volume sellers.
- **CutGlueBuild Marketplace (Coming Soon)** – Sell custom project files and finished goods.

### Your Own Website

Set up a store on:
- **Shopify** – Great if you're serious.
- **Squarespace** – Good for service + product hybrid.
- **Sellfy** or **Gumroad** – For digital SVGs and templates.

---

## Step 7: Price for Profit

Don’t just double your material costs.

**Pricing Formula:**
(Materials + Time + Overhead) x Markup = Price

yaml
Copy
Edit

- Time = Your hourly rate (at least $25/hr)
- Overhead = Software, utilities, packaging
- Markup = 2x to 4x depending on uniqueness

Charge more for personalization and fast turnaround.

## Step 8: Promote Your Shop

Use social media **consistently** — not just when launching.

- Instagram Reels: Time-lapses of your process
- Pinterest: Top source for craft sales
- TikTok: Behind the scenes or educational snippets
- Facebook groups: Connect with local and niche communities

Use affiliate partners like [Cluckboss](https://97d8d7ywcwyh6pb0vni7gl6hdf.hop.clickbank.net) if you're in the chicken coop niche or [ShedPlans](https://0d6b98zqcv5p6v7nu8okvwupd6.hop.clickbank.net) if you want to bundle your work with related tools.

---

## Step 9: Deliver a Great Customer Experience

- Offer fast and safe shipping
- Follow up with a thank you email
- Encourage customers to leave reviews

---

## Step 10: Scale Up

Once you're making consistent sales:

- **Automate orders** using tools like Make.com or Zapier
- Outsource laser cutting or packaging
- License your designs on CutGlueBuild
- Expand into wholesale or subscription boxes
