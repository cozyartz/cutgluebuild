## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Design Your Shape

Use a rounded rectangle and add a triangle or arc to create a “stake” point. Keep proportions ergonomic: about 5–6” tall by 1.25” wide.

### 2. Add Your Text

Use clean, readable fonts. Good choices include:
- **Montserrat**
- **Lora**
- **Fira Sans**

Center your text horizontally, then place it in the top half.

### 3. Add Icons (Optional)

Use SVG icons for herbs/vegetables or hand-draw them. Try:
- [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com)
- [CutGlueBuild Templates](https://cutgluebuild.com/templates)

### 4. Prepare for Laser

- **Cut Layer:** Thin red stroke for outer shape
- **Engrave Layer:** Black fill for text/icon
- **Group elements** so they don't shift

### 5. Test Settings

Always run a test pass:
- Power/speed will vary by wood type
- Use scrap plywood or MDF

For example:
- Proofgrade Medium Maple:  
  **Engrave:** 1000 speed / 20 power  
  **Cut:** 300 speed / 100 power

### 6. Cut & Finish

After cutting:
- Optionally **fill engravings** with paint pens
- Add a **sealant spray** or epoxy resin to weatherproof
- Sand edges if using non-Proofgrade wood

## Creative Variations

- **Shape Themes:** Leaf silhouettes, trowel shapes, badge-style
- **Engraving Ideas:** Botanical illustrations, garden quotes, sun/moon symbols
- **Product Ideas:** Bundle sets of “Herbs” or “Vegetables” for Etsy
