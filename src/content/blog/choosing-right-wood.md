## Why Wood Type Matters üå≤

When you're laser cutting, the type of wood you choose affects:

- **Cut quality**: Hardwoods like maple cut clean but scorch more easily.
- **Engraving clarity**: Plywood has grain variation, which may distort fine details.
- **Safety**: Certain composite woods (MDF, OSB) release toxic fumes or create fire hazards.

Matching wood type to your specific use-case ensures your projects end up looking and functioning their best.

## Popular Woods for Laser Cutting

### 1. **Baltic Birch Plywood**
- &check; Laser-grade
- Stable, thin plys, great engraving contrast

**Tips:** Start with 1/8‚Ä≥ or 3mm thickness. Runs clean and consistent.

### 2. **Maple Hardwood**
- &check; High contrast engraving, smooth cuts

**Warning:** Scorches easily ‚Äî reduce power and test first.

### 3. **Cherry Wood**
- Glows with deep, rich tones after engraving

**Tip:** Sand lightly after cutting to reduce burn residue.

### 4. **Basswood**
- Light weight, easy to cut, clean gray engraving

**Best Use:** Models, prototypes ‚Äî no scorching, just smooth edges.

### 5. **Acrylic + Wood Laminate**
- Use for layered styling and deep color effects
- Engraving seems boxed out‚Äî great for logos

## Softwood vs Hardwood

| Type        | Easy to Cut | Engraving Detail | Strength       | Best Use                        |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Softwood    | Very Easy | Fine Lines     | Moderate Strength    | Models, signs, prototypes       |
| Hardwood    | Harder    | Great Detail   | Strong      | Functional parts, robust builds|

## Safety & Ventilation ‚ö†Ô∏è

Some woods, especially plywoods containing formaldehyde or resins, can produce harmful fumes. Always:

1. Run your laser with proper **air assist** or **ventilation**.
2. Double-check your local regulations for **formal-dehyde textures**.
3. Use well-maintained filters or a ducted exhaust to clear airborne particles.

## Quick Checklist Before You Start

1. Choose wood with minimal resin (pine nicknamed "resin river" may scorch).
2. Pick pre-sanded, laser-grade wood for smoother engraving.
3. Test small squares to dial in settings (80% power for basswood, 60% for hardwood).
4. Document settings by wood type ‚Äî creates a buildable material library.

## Final Thoughts

Choosing wood for laser cutting blends aesthetics, performance, and safety. Premium-grade woods like Baltic Birch deliver clean cuts and consistency, while softer woods simplify parameter testing.

Match your wood to your project's design and function. You'll enjoy faster runs and excellent finishes.
