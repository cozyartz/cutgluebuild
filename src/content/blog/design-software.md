Laser cutting begins with great design‚Äîand that starts with the right software. In this post, we‚Äôll explore a curated list of tools tailored to beginners, makers, and pros alike, from classic vector editors like Adobe Illustrator to free, open-source solutions like Inkscape, and even cutting-edge AI-powered platforms like Freepik. You‚Äôll also learn how these integrate with CutGlueBuild's SVG generator, giving you a complete toolkit for bringing your ideas to laser-ready reality.

## 1. Adobe Illustrator ‚Äì The Industry Standard

**What it is:** A vector graphics powerhouse by Adobe, used widely by professionals for logos, illustrations, and precise drawings.

**Why it matters:** Illustrator offers complete control‚Äîpaths, points, layers, exports in SVG/PDF, and plugins tailored for laser-cut workflows like exporting cut/engrave layers.

**Best for:** Designers collaborating with pros, producing commercial work, or needing fine detail. The Creative Cloud subscription is around $20‚Äì$30/mo, but the investment pays off in advanced features and ecosystem integration.

**Tips:**
- Use **Artboards** sized to your laser bed.
- Separate **cut lines** (typically red and thinner) from **engraving** (filled or thicker).
- Enable **SVG Profiles** to bake in compatibility for Glowforge, Cricut, or Epilogue.

## 2. Inkscape ‚Äì Free & Open Source

A powerful **no-cost alternative** to Illustrator, Inkscape uses the same SVG format and supports nearly all vector features. It offers:
- Paths, shape tools, layers, gradients, boolean operations.
- **Trace Bitmap** to convert images ‚Äî useful for import workflows.
- **Extensions & Plugins**, including laser-export presets.

**New features** in v1.4+ improve usability, including layouts, effects, and improved import/export tools :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

**Who it‚Äôs for:** Budget-conscious creators, educators, students, hobbyists‚Äîand even pros who need a free backup tool.

**Tip:** Set document size to match your laser, then group layers based on cut vs. engrave work.

## 3. Freepik AI ‚Äì Next-Level Imagery

[Freepik](https://www.freepik.com) has branched into **AI-powered content**, offering:

- **Image-to-image generation**, perfect for generating backgrounds, textures, or inspiration.
- **Sketch-to-image tools**, which convert your rough sketches into polished visuals.
- A stock library of **vector templates and mockups**, including SVGs ready for cutting :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

**Who benefits:** Non-designers who want pro-looking images without doing the drawing‚Äîor inspiration hunters looking for quick mockups.

**Tip:** Export generated images as SVG or PNG, import into Inkscape or Illustrator, vectorize further, and drop into CutGlueBuild‚Äôs AI SVG Generator for final tweaks.

## 4. Autodesk Fusion‚ÄØ360 ‚Äì 3D + 2D for Laser & CNC

While mainly CAD for CNC, Fusion 360 includes **2D drawing routines**, AI-assisted constraints, automated features, and export tools for SVGs and DXF :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

Best for:
- Projects combining **laser-cut panels** with **machined parts**.
- Users wanting parametric control, measurements, and export-ready cutting files.

**Tip:** Use the "Sketch" tool to draw your design; then export that sketch to SVG for engraving outlines.

## 5. Our Own CutGlueBuild AI SVG Generator

Of course, we built our **SVG AI tool** to handle common design tasks fast:

- Describe what you want (‚Äúmandala coasters with flower petals,‚Äù etc.)
- Choose cut vs. engrave layers.
- Instantly download ready-to-laser SVG.

With 100 credits per month on Pro, ideal for experimenting, iterating, and finalizing designs.

## 6. Other Notables

- **Affinity Designer** ‚Äì Affordable one-time purchase ($60), vector-first, strong export tools.
- **Gravit Designer** ‚Äì Web-based, free version includes SVG export.
- **Sketch** (macOS only) ‚Äì Popular in UI/UX world, exports SVG easily.
- **Figma** ‚Äì Web tool with communal design features; usable for basic cut paths.

## AI Tools in the Space

- **Midjourney / DALL¬∑E / Stable Diffusion** ‚Äì Great for concept art but need tracing to vector.
- **Freepik AI** ‚Äì Built for vector generation; see above.
- **CutGlueBuild SVG AI** ‚Äì Laser-tool-specific: prompts ‚Üí cut-ready files.
