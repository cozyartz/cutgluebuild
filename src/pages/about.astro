    <p class="mb-6">
      CutGlueBuild is on a mission to radically simplify the way people design and fabricate for laser cutting and engraving.
      We believe creativity should be frictionless — not stuck in complicated software or limited by steep learning curves.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Our platform blends AI-powered design generation with collaborative editing tools, so makers, designers, and businesses
      can rapidly go from idea to cut-ready files. Whether you're prototyping, personalizing, or producing at scale,
      CutGlueBuild is here to streamline your workflow.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Built by a small team of designers, engineers, and tinkerers, we're obsessed with the details and passionate about empowering creators.
      Every feature, every template, and every pixel is crafted with makers in mind.
