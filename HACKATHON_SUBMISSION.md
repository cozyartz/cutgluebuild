    },
    {
      role: "user", 
      content: contextualPromptWithUserHistory
    }
  ],
  max_tokens: 2500,
  temperature: 0.7
});

// Quality analysis using gpt-oss-20b for focused tasks
const qualityAnalysis = await this.ai.run('@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b', {
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a fabrication quality expert..."
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Analyze this design: ${svgData}`
